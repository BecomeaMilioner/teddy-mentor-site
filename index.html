      <h2>Who's This Bear Yelling At You?</h2>
      <p>Meet <strong>Teddy The Mentor</strong>, the legendary bear who allegedly went from eating berries to driving Lambos* in just 3 days! (*According to some random dude on Twitter, anyway. Details fuzzy).</p>
      <p>Tired of the 9-to-5 grind? Sick of actual effort? PERFECT! Teddy's revolutionary (and totally unique, pinky promise!) digital course will teach you how to... well, mostly it provides elite-tier memes and a vague sense of superiority. Hey, that's something, right? 💸</p>
      <p><strong>$MENTOR</strong> isn't just <em>another</em> meme coin. It's THE meme coin flipping the bird at every self-proclaimed Instagram "guru," every get-rich-quick charlatan, and anyone who genuinely believes "waking up at 5 AM" is the answer to everything.</p>
      <p>Ready to join the revolution? (Or at least gamble on a token that <em>might</em> pump while mocking the entire system?)</p>

            <div class="roadmap-item">
                <h3>Phase 1: Massive Hype!</h3>
                <p>Make tons of noise, tweet absolute nonsense, make everyone think this is the next big thing. Mandatory course purchase required!</p>
                <div class="status">Status: ✅ Done (Duh.)</div>
            </div>
            <div class="roadmap-item">
                <h3>Phase 2: ??? Profit?</h3>
                <p>Uhhh... we're working on it. Maybe more memes? Perhaps drop an exclusive NFT collection of Teddy doing 'power poses'? Launch a webinar on 'How to Look Busy While Doing Nothing'? TBD. Will decide after our third coffee.</p>

                <p>Obviously. All meme coins go to the moon. It's like, physics or something. Just make sure you buy more $MENTOR on the way up! Don't be poor AND miss the rocket!</p>
